# Order Grid Heatmap

This repository contains a simple Leaflet demo that draws 1×1 km grid cells only for locations where orders exist. Each cell is colored according to the sum of orders that fall inside it (0–1 green, 1–3 yellow, 3+ red). The sample data includes a single order; add more points in the `orders` array inside `index.html`.
